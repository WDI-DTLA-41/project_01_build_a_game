      <p>The objective of connect four is to align 4 of the same colors vertically, horizontally, or
          diagonally. The first player to accomplish this task is the winner.</p>
      <p>Player 1 has been pre-selected as the red chip, and Player 2 has been pre-selected as the green chip.</p>
      <p>When the game begins Player 1 receives the first opportunity to position his/her piece. Above the actual game board
          there are 7 selector pieces. These are known as the move selectors. When you place the mouse over the any of these
          7 corresponding pieces the piece will change to the color of the player who's turn it is. Once a move selector has been
           selected, a piece will be inserted in to the column of the selected piece at the bottom most position of the board.</p>
      <p>Once a move has been made, it will now be player 2's turn until the same process is repeated.</p>
      <p>When the game is concluded a tally of the winner and loser will be kept in the score box located underneath
         the Player's Turn box. 3 seconds after the games conclusion the board will automatically reset to its initial 'Game Not Active'
          state to give the users an opportunity to either play again or initiate another type of match.

      <p>The game begins in an isolated state, signified by the 'Game Not Active' notification in the Player's Turn box.
          The state of the game is identified by the Player's Turn box located in the upper
          left hand corner of the game board. To initiate a game the user must select which type of game that will be played.</p>
      <p>There are two types of matches to select from, the first match type is the PvP (Player vs Player), i.e. the 'Start Game' button.
           This match type is the traditional connect four match up where players compete to accomplish connecting 4 of their
           pieces in a row. The second match type is the tournament match, i.e. the 'Start Tournament Button'. If selected the user will
           play for the best out of 5 games.</p>
      <p>Once a tournament match has been selected the game will initiate automatically, just like the start game button. The state of the
          game will be updated and the move selectors will become active. When an initial match is completed the game will tally the winner
          in the Tournament Score box, and will then immediately initiate the following match up and render a winner when a player has
          won the Tournament.</p>
      <p>If you are thinking that all of this is too complicated let me assure you that it is not, but don't just take my word for it,
           experience has and always will be the best teacher. So what are you waiting for, let's get started!!!</p>
