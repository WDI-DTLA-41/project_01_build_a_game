### Hangman aka. Stay Off the Hook

Hangman a word guessing game. Stay off the hook is my version 
of Hangman. It is ocean themed and more specifically based on the 
scientific names of sharks. I hope this can serve as an 
educational game for marine biology students having trouble
remembering these tongue twisitng names.
