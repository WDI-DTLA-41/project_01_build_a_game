### B) How to Play:

**i. Objective:
The objective of this card game is to beat the dealer's score.

**Rules: 
The highest possible score is 21, going over results in a 'bust', which forfeits your hand.
Jacks, Queens & Kings are worth 10 points each, all number cards represent their face value, with the exception of Ace.
Ace counts as 11 points, unless it causes you to go over 21, in which case it can be used as 1.
The game starts with the player & the dealer being dealt 2 cards each. Dealer only shows one card. Player acts first. Each card drawn adds to the points tally.

**Instructions: 
1. Click 'New Hand' to begin.
2. 'Deal Cards' initiates dealing and gives the dealer & player two cards each.
3. Click on 'Hit' if you want to draw another card
4. Click on 'Stay' if you wish to end your turn. The dealer's turn commences after you stay.
5. At the end of the round, to start a new round, click 'New Hand.'

**Bugs: 
1. Occasionally, Hit & Stay are still clickable even though player hits BlackJack on deal but dealer doesn't. The game should automatically end. And only New Hand should be clickable.

**Planned Features:
1. Double Down
2. Split
3. Multiplayer
4. Betting
