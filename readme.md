## Rules:

* Click "Start" or press the "Enter" key to play.

* The game will play back a random sequence of colors, starting at one color and adding one more to the sequence for each round. Click the colors in the same order to move to the next round.  You can use the mouse or the arrow keys on your keyboard.  If you click the wrong color, you lose and must start from the beginning.

* Click the "Playback" button at any time to hear the most recent sequence.

* Once you complete 20 rounds, you win.
