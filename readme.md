**Simon Game**

*Technologies Used*
1. HTML/CSS
2. Javascript
3. jQuery
4. animate.CSS
5. Github Pages

*Getting Started / How to Play*
1. Start game by clicking 'Start' button
2. Simon will start by giving it's sequence of signals first,
    and then flashing gray background to indicate user's turn.
3. Click signals in same order to match Simon's sequence
4. Beat your Session Streak to "win" and don't hit a signal out of turn!

*Next Steps*
* Timer (maximum of 3 seconds between user inputs once user turn is started)
* Make tiered difficulty levels (by speeding up simonSequence flashing)
* Implement multi-player and corresponding winners/losers
* Make game playable on keyboard (number keys = color selection)
