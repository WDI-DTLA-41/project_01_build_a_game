Blackjack:
A card game where a dealer and a player try to reach
a total of 21 without going over.  The  point value  
is equal to the number amount on each card drawn.  
Face cards count as 10 points and an Ace counts as
1 or 11 depending on how it is played.

Technologies Used:





Getting Started:
The Dealer and The Players are each dealt two cards. 
Each player will play against the dealer, not each
other.  First player to 21 wins or closest to it, 
without going over.
