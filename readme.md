STAR WAR!

The object of the game is to collect all of the cards in play. 

A deck of 52 cards is shuffled and dealed out to both teams, The Empire and 
Rebel Forces. 

Instructions: 

1. To begin the game, the user will press the "Shuffle" button to shuffle 
the plain deck of cards visible a top the game board.  

2. To deal out the cards, the user will then press the "Deal" button.  Now
we are ready to play. 

3. To begin each round, the user will push a card in play by pressing 
the "Push" button.

4. To battle with his opponent, the user will then push the "Battle" 
button to compare both cards in play.  The card with the highest numerical
value wins, and the winning player will then collect both cards in 
play.

5. While in battle, the two cards in play may be of equal numerical 
value.  In this case, war will be waged.  Both teams push an additional
four cards into play by pressing the "War" button.  

The fourth card pushed in play will be evaluated, and the higher card 
wins.  The winning team will then collect all cards in play.  If both 
cards in war are of equal value, the process will repeat and an additional
four cards will be pushed into play.

6. The game is over when either player runs out of cards in their hand, 
at which point they lose by default.  

7. To restart the game, the user may press the "Reset" button to push 
all cards back into the deck to be shuffled and dealt out at a later time.
