# Crowns
Synopsis

This project is the first project built in my third week of attending the Web Development Immersive course at Generaly Assembly. This project demonstrates and displays my understanding of the concepts covered in class pertaining to Javascript, DOM Manipulation, CSS and HTML.



Game Instructions

The game of Crowns is modeled after the classic game of checkers.
Be the first to eliminate your opponent and win.


Game Play

- The game starts with the green checkers and then alternates players.
- Each player must make only one move per turn moving forward one black tile at a time unless jumping an opponent.
- Players may jump opponents to remove the jumped piece from the game board.
- If a player's checker reaches the other side of the board it is crowned and can now move backwards and forwards claiming opponents along the way.
- The first player to eliminate all opponent checkers wins the game.
