### Neon Simon

This game is called Neon Simon and is a visual memory game.
It is designed to test how well the user can memorize the sequence 
of flashing colors. As the user selects the correct color pattern the 
game will continue to progress and add an additional color to the 
color pattern sequence.

### Technologies

This game was created using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript along with 
JQuery and underscore.js libraries. 

### Instructions

The user will press the Start button and the game will start.
Once the game starts one of the colored buttons will flash along with a 
sound and then wait for the user to click on the corresponding button. 
If the user responds correctly then the game will replay the sequence 
and add an additional color flash to the end of that sequence. If the 
user can not correctly input the sequence or respond within the alloted
time then the user will lose and the game will end. When the user reaches
levels of the increment of five or 11 there will follow a praise message.
If the user can achieve level 35 the user will have beat the game and 
receive a victory message and song but the game will continue. When the
Hard button is pressed the game will start but in a higher degree of 
difficulty than the normal start button. The flashing sequence will be 
faster and the reponse time will be shorter for the user to input the 
sequence. The color flashes will have an uniform audio clip and the 
there will be no praise for any level achievement. When the user presses
the Replay button the sequence from the last played game will replay. 

### Unsolved Problems and Planned Features

One issue that was unsolved was the ability to check the user's sequence
immediately after the user clicks a color button. Other planned features
would include more play style options and challenges. I would have also 
like to add an addtional color button for an extra challenege. I think 
another feature be to kept track of all the high scores that were 
reached from previous games and a place to see their names.
