## Getting Started

Contrary to popular belief, the object of blackjack is NOT: getting as close to a score of 21 without going over.

The __OBJECT__ of blackjack is to beat the dealer. 

The very first step is that the player must not bust (have a score over 21).
Secondly and finally, the player must either outscore the dealer or have the dealer bust.

TO play, place a bet and deal the cards. Use strategic hit/stay to beat the dealer.

'Hit' draws another card while 'stay' ends your turn.

Be careful entering into debt as being unable to pay back your casino marker is a felony!

## Next Steps

### Unsolved Issues

Some code refactoring would be needed to animate the dealing of cards in a way that is not instant and more visually appealing. This is likely due to the FOR loop which deals the cards instantly.

In addition, due to the random CSS hacking, each card dealt increases the browser length of the page.

### Planned Features

Refactor code:
- For animating ability
- For splitting
- For browser length
- For dynamically changing card positions

Add:
- Vegas style 8 decks and card discarding
- Double down & corresponding dynamically rotated card visual
- Insurance
- 3:2 payout on natural blackjack
- JS documentation
