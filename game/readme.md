## Getting Started

Contrary to popular belief, the object of blackjack is NOT: gettting as close to a score of 21 without going over.

The __OBJECT__ of blackjack is to beat the dealer. 

The very first step is that the player must not bust (have a score over 21).
Secondly and finally, the player must either outscore the dealer or have the dealer bust.
