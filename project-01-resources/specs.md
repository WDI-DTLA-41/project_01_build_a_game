# ![](../../resources/assets/ga-icon-small.png) Client-side Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really
**tough programming challenges** - it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game
to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding
you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

As a reminder, your project's code **must be substantially yours**. Do not copy code from other similar projects. 
However, relying on techniques and a line of code here and there found on StackOverflow is okay. BE SURE TO ATTRIBUTE IT.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Render a game in the browser**
- **Code win and/or loss logic and render in HTML.**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Use **Use native Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, using GitHub Pages, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

Niceties:

- **Make a two player game.** Switch turns between two players and display which player won.
- **Be formatted for mobile**

### Necessary Deliverables
- Pseudo code for your game logic
- A set of User Stories (or features) that describe your game, in the following
  categories:
  1. MVP
  2. Completed
  2. Icebox.
- **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
  1. A description of your game (***[Use Your Game's Name]***)
  2. List of the technologies used (**Technologies Used**),
  3. How to play instructions (**Getting Started**), and
  4. Unsolved problems and/or planned features (**Next Steps**).
- The code for **a working game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub,
  with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- The game, **hosted on the internet**, with a link to it provided in the URL
  section of your Github repo.

**Be prepared to share the following with the class first thing Tuesday morning:**

1. Your choice of game.
2. Pseudocode for your overall game-play logic.
3. Wireframes

### Suggestions

- **Begin by wireframing and whiteboarding!** Think generally about how you'd
  like your game to work.
- **Frame the users' interaction with the game in terms of User Stories.**
- **Use your Development Tools** (`console.log`, inspector, `alert` statements,
  etc.) to debug and solve problems.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
  you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, etc.) to better understand
  what you’ll be getting into.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**
  Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real
  data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to
  change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose
  game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

**Theme your game** to make it more unique!
